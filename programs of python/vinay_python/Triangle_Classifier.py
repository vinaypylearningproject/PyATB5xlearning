#Write a program that classifies a triangle based on its side lengths.
# Given three input values representing the lengths of the sides,
# determine if the triangle is equilateral (all sides are equal),
# isosceles (exactly two sides are equal), or scalene (no sides are equal).
# Use an if-else statement to classify the triangle.

side1 = 5
side2 = 8
side3 = 7

if side1 == side2 == side3:
    print("Equilateral triangle")
elif side1 == side2 or side1 == side3 or side2 == side3:
    print("Isosceles triangle")
else:
    print("Scalene triangle")
